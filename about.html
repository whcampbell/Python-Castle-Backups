                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Attending UW-Madison for college, I started my time there in
                    pursuit of a degree in Computer Science. I enjoyed the new challenge;
                    neither I nor any of my family had done any kind of programming before.
                    I also felt like I was suited to it, and I found joy in the work of
                    making something functional where there once was nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time in school, I took a grand tour through programming
                    fundamentals in Java, architecture in C, graphics in Javascript,
                    AI in Python, and more. I was also able to grow my experience by
                    serving an internship at Subzero-Wolf group on their Website team.
                    Not only did I run manual tests as a part of their agile cycle, but
                    I also maintained and expanded their automated testing codebase with
                    C# Selenium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my personal time, I have expanded my abilities by experimenting with
                    website and game design, as well as taking online courses in SQL. On a
                    seemingly different note, I've spent a lot of time in the last few
                    years making art. My work has included drawing (pencil, charcoal, ink),
                    painting (acrylic, oil, watercolor), and printmaking (relief, multi-block).
                    This may not seem to fit the 'career overview' section. However, I believe
                    that creativity is vital in devising solutions and making strong
                    interpersonal connections, and is therefore indispensable in the workplace.

                <h2>Expanded Work History</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was sixteen years old, I have worked at a total of eight jobs,
                    generally customer service.
                    I thought it would be a crime to not mention them, even though they
                    don't exactly sparkle on a software engineer resume.
                    No matter what, they still point to a good amount of personal drive
                    and hardworking attitude.

                <p>
                    Multitasking prep, deliveries, dishes, and slingin' pies
                </p>
                <h3>Residence Hall Custodian</h3>
                <p>
                    Doing the dirty work
                </p>
                <h3>Bakery Front Counter</h3>
                <p>
                    Had to wake up at 5:30 for these shifts
                </p>

                <h3>Table Server</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to sitting up in bed at 1 AM thinking that you're late
                    to greeting a table
                </p>
                <h3>QA Tester</h3>
                <p>
                    This one is on the resume, just keeping the count consistent
                </p>
                <h3>Volleyball Referee</h3>
                <p>
                    They didn't even have to pay me for this one, so much did I
                    enjoy calling people out for being bad at volleyball
                </p>
                <h3>Art Store Sales Associate</h3>
                <p>
                    Constant research was necessary since I could be hit with
                    questions like "what brush is best for ceramic underglazing"
                    at any moment (the answer is a cheap one)
                </p>
                <h3>Brewery Porter</h3>
                <p>
                    Moving plates around at MN's most successful craft brewery -
                    it only took me 4 months to get most valuable employee for the
                    front of house

                <h2>Volunteer Experience</h2>
                <h3>Classroom Assistant</h3>
                <p>
                    I spent two weeks serving in classrooms at Irving elementary
                    school in West Allis, WI. This school's mission is to be
                    inclusive to children of all backgrounds and cognitive ableness.
                    It was very rewarding to get to know these students and find out
                    exactly the best way to help their unique way of learning.
                </p>
                <h3>Scratch Club Leader</h3>
                <p>
                    In this position, a few partners and I took the leadership role
                    to run a club which would teach Scratch programming to 4th and
                    5th grade students. They say that you only truly understand
                    something when you can explain it simply. Trying to explain
                    programming concepts to these younger kids put that to the test.
                </p>
                <h3>Violence Prevention Team Member</h3>
                <p>
                    While I was a member of the UW Badger Marching Band, I served
                    on the team which educated new recruits as well as returning
                    members on strategies for bystander intervention, recognizing
                    intimate partner violence, and more. We would design workshops
                    and presentations, and we would moderate small-group discussions
                    to raise awareness and make sure that our community was a safe one.
