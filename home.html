            <h3>You look gorgeous today</h3>
            <p>
                I guess I could say that this website exists for a few reasons. The
                first and foremost was for me to get a job. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Not that switching on a Django website right out of the box is all 
                that impressive. I just wanted to make it clear that I know at least 
                a thing or two. My games can also speak for that (hopefully). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another reason was to build a bit of personality around the art that
                I make. I like to write, and I like to make drawings and paintings. 
                This seemed like a good place to store both of those things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last reason was that I wanted attention. Not really, I explain
                a little further in the Journal pages. That being said, a bit of 
                attention would not hurt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter what reason you visited, I hope that you enjoy what you find.<br> 
                Thanks for being here.<br>
